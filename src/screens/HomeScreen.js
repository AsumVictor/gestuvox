            Our goal is to create a future where everyone, regardless of how
            they communicate, feels understood and connected. We aim to break
            down barriers between sign and spoken language, fostering a world
            where deaf individuals can easily interact and share their stories
            with others.

        description="I am interested in pursuing computer science and Psychology, where I can combine my computational and quantitative skills with my love for health psychology. I am interested in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to analyze large datasets about mental health. These datasets can include electronic health records (EHRs) and social media data. By applying data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, these models can identify patterns and insights that can help us better understand risk factors for mental health issues, predict potential problems, and provide personalized interventions.

I am also interested in contributing to brain-computer interface (BCI) projects by developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with labeled data so that they can learn to map brain signal features to specific classes or actions. This would allow my AI to classify brain signals and determine the intended user command or action for psychological treatment purposes.
In addition, I am also committed to establishing resilient systems and protocols that safeguard sensitive information. I believe that it is important to foster trust in digital mental health solutions and ensure compliance with stringent privacy regulations.
