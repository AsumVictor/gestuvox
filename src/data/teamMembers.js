    role: "Linguistic researcher",
    bio: `
   I am determined to break down language barriers and enhance communication in healthcare delivery to people who have sensory and cognitive impairments. My goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of AI technologies, algorithms, and language models through intensive studies and courses in computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
By applying my knowledge in computational linguistics, I aspire to create innovative and intelligent technologies that can revolutionize healthcare services for those who are nonverbal, have hearing impairments, or suffer from language difficulties caused by brain disorders.

    role: "Programming Lead",
    bio: ` I am interested in pursuing computer science and Robotics, where I can combine my computational, especially Artificial Intelligence and engineering skills to solve societal problems. I am interested in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to help translate Sign Languages to voice synthesis or text to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and the deaf community. I'm also curious to research computational agriculture where I will be making smart autonomous robots and precision agriculture to handle tedious and complex agricultural activities in Africa.
Again, I wish to be on TEDx as a public speaker.`,

    bio: `I am highly enthusiastic about pursuing an interdisciplinary advancement in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, complemented by a sub-discipline in sociology. My passion lies in utilizing technology to tackle the problem of digital inequality that affects individuals with disabilities. Specifically, I aim to focus on integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning within the design of assistive technologies, with the ultimate goal of bridging the accessibility gap for these individuals while understanding the struggles faced by disabled persons through sociology. Here, I can combine my leadership, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of social dynamics with my taste for electrical systems, computing infrastructure, and human assistive technologies to develop holistic approaches to tackle digital inequality in African societies.`,
