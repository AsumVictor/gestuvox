    role: "Linguistic researcher",
    bio: `
    I have a strong motivation to overcome language barriers and improve communication in healthcare. That's why I want to study computer science as my major and linguistics as my minor. My objective is to acquire a profound comprehension of artificial intelligence technologies, algorithms, and language models through extensive study and courses focused on computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

My ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to enhance and construct adaptive technology that can aid in communication during the provision of healthcare services to those who are nonverbal, have hearing impairments, or suffer from language difficulties caused by brain disorders.

    role: "Programming Lead",
    bio: `I am interested in pursuing computer science and Psychology, where I can combine my computational and quantitative skills with my love for health psychology. I am interested in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to analyze large datasets about mental health. These datasets can include electronic health records (EHRs) and social media data. By applying data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, these models can identify patterns and insights that can help us better understand risk factors for mental health issues, predict potential problems, and provide personalized interventions.

        I am also interested in contributing to brain-computer interface (BCI) projects by developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with labeled data so that they can learn to map brain signal features to specific classes or actions. This would allow my AI to classify brain signals and determine the intended user command or action for psychological treatment purposes.
        In addition, I am also committed to establishing resilient systems and protocols that safeguard sensitive information. I believe that it is important to foster trust in digital mental health solutions and ensure compliance with stringent privacy regulations.`,

    bio: `I am highly enthusiastic about pursuing an interdisciplinary advancement in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, complemented by a sub-discipline in sociology. My passion lies in utilizing technology to tackle the problem of digital inequality that affects individuals with disabilities. Specifically, I aim to focus on integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning within the design of assistive technologies, with the ultimate goal of bridging the accessibility gap for these individuals while understanding the struggles faced by disabled persons through sociology. Here, I can combine my leadership, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of social dynamics with my taste for electrical systems, computing infrastructure, and human assistive technologies to develop holistic approaches to tackle digital inequality in African societies.`,
